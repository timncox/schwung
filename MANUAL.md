# Schwung Manual

## What is Schwung?

Schwung adds four instrument slots that run in "shadow mode" alongside your normal Move tracks. Each slot can host synthesizers and effects that mix with Move's audio output.

**Key concepts:**
- **Shadow Mode**: A custom UI accessed via keyboard shortcuts
- **Slots**: Four instrument slots plus a Master FX slot
- **Modules**: Synthesizers, audio effects, and MIDI effects that run in each slot
- **Overtake Modules**: Full-screen applications that take over Move's UI (like MIDI controllers)

---

## Important Notice

This is an unofficial project that modifies the software on your Ableton Move. Back up any important sets and samples before installing. Familiarize yourself with Move's DFU restore mode (on Centercode) in case you need to restore your device.

Move still works normally after installation - Schwung runs alongside it.

---

## Installation

### Desktop Installer (Recommended)

Download the [Schwung Installer](https://github.com/charlesvestal/schwung-installer/releases/latest) for your platform (macOS, Windows, Linux). It handles SSH setup, module selection, and upgrades via a graphical interface.

### Command Line

**Prerequisites:** Move connected to WiFi, a computer on the same network.

Run:
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesvestal/schwung/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The installer will guide you through SSH setup, download the framework, and offer to install modules.

After installation, Move will restart automatically.

### Module Management (Command Line)

Install, remove, or update individual modules without reinstalling the full framework.

**Install a module from GitHub:**
```
./scripts/install.sh install-module-github charlesvestal/move-anything-braids
```

**Install from a specific branch:**
```
./scripts/install.sh install-module-github charlesvestal/move-anything-braids/dev
```

**Install from a local tarball:**
```
./scripts/install.sh install-module braids-module.tar.gz
```

**Remove a module:**
```
./scripts/install.sh uninstall-module braids
```

The installer auto-detects the module's type (sound generator, audio FX, etc.) and places it in the correct directory.

---

## Uninstall

Run:
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesvestal/schwung/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh
```

By default, uninstall exports inactive Set Pages backups to `/data/UserData/UserLibrary/Schwung Backups/Set Pages/` before removing Schwung.

To skip that export and permanently delete Schwung data:
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesvestal/schwung/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh -s -- --purge-data
```

---

## Shortcuts

All shortcuts use **Shift + touch Volume knob** as a modifier:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Shift+Vol + Track 1-4**| Open that slot's editor |
| **Shift+Vol + Note/Session** | Open Master FX |
| **Shift+Vol + Step 2** | Open Global Settings |
| **Shift+Vol + Step 13** | Open Tools Menu |
| **Shift+Vol + Jog Click** | Open Overtake menu (or exit Overtake mode) |
| **Shift+Vol + Back** | Suspend Overtake module (keep running in background) |
| **Shift+Sample** | Open Quantized Sampler |
| **Shift+Capture** | Skipback (save last 30 seconds) |
| **Shift+Vol + Left/Right** | Switch set page (when enabled) |

**Tip:** You can access slots directly from normal Move mode - you don't need to be in shadow mode first.

### Long-Press Shortcuts (Optional)

If you prefer not to use the Shift+Vol combo, you can enable **Long Press** mode in **Global Settings > Shortcuts**. This adds alternative shortcuts that don't require touching the volume knob:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Hold Track 1-4** (500ms) | Open that slot's editor |
| **Hold Note/Session** (500ms) | Open Master FX |
| **Shift + hold Step 2** (500ms) | Open Global Settings |
| **Shift + Step 13** | Open Tools Menu (immediate) |
| **Tap Track** (while shadow UI is shown) | Dismiss shadow UI |
| **Tap Note/Session** (while shadow UI is shown) | Dismiss shadow UI |

When enabled, holding Shift also lights the Step 2 and Step 13 LEDs as a reminder.

The original Shift+Vol shortcuts continue to work regardless of this setting.

### Overlay Knob Shortcut

The knob parameter overlay shown in native Move mode has a separate trigger setting:

- Go to **Global Settings > Display > Overlay Knobs**
- Choose **+Shift** (default), **+Jog Touch**, **Off**, or **Native**
- If native Move's **Shift+Knob** actions (like fine control) are getting blocked, switch this to **+Jog Touch** or **Off**

---

## Instrument Slots

Each of the four instrument slots contains a signal chain:

```
MIDI FX → Sound Generator → Audio FX 1 → Audio FX 2
```

### Navigating a Slot

- **Jog wheel**: Scroll between chain positions (MIDI FX, Synth, FX1, FX2, Settings)
- **Jog click**: Enter the selected position
- **Back button**: Go back one level

### Selecting Modules

1. Navigate to an empty position and click the jog wheel
2. Choose from installed modules of that type

**Tip:** To swap a module that's already loaded, highlight it in the slot editor and hold **Shift + Jog Click**. This opens the module picker so you can replace it without clearing the slot first.

### Using Modules

Most modules have:
- **Preset browser**: Use jog wheel to browse presets, click to select
- **Parameter menu**: Editable settings organized hierarchically
- **Knob assignments**: Knobs 1-8 control relevant parameters when a module is selected

---

## Slot Settings

The last position in each slot contains settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Knob 1-8** | Assign any module parameter to a knob. These work even in normal Move mode (hold Shift + turn knob). |
| **Volume** | Slot volume level |
| **Receive Ch** | MIDI channel this slot listens to (match your Move track's MIDI Out) |
| **Forward Ch** | MIDI channel sent to the synth module (see below) |
| **MIDI FX** | Schw (default) or Schw+Move — where the slot's MIDI FX output lands (see below) |
| **LFO 1 / LFO 2** | Modulation LFOs (see below) |

**Forward Channel modes:**
- **Auto** (default): Remaps MIDI to the slot's receive channel. If Receive Ch is "All", passes through unchanged.
- **Thru**: Passes the original MIDI channel through unchanged — useful for multitimbral synths that respond differently on each channel.
- **1-16**: Forces all MIDI to a specific channel regardless of what was received.

**MIDI FX modes (Schw vs Schw+Move):**
- **Schw** (default): The slot's MIDI FX output goes only to the slot synth. Move's native track instrument keeps playing whatever you played on the pad (unchanged from pre-0.10 behaviour).
- **Schw+Move**: The MIDI FX output *also* gets injected back into Move's MIDI input on the slot's forward channel, so Move's native track instrument plays the transformed stream additively alongside the slot synth. Best use: a **Chord MIDI FX** — hold one pad, Move plays the root (from the pad) while the chord's harmony notes also play on Move's native track.
- **Limitations**: a generator-style MIDI FX (e.g., Arp) emitting the same pitch you're holding on the pad won't retrigger that pitch on Move — its pattern is silent on Move for a single-pad hold. This is a technical limitation of telling our injected echoes apart from your pad release on the same note. Chord works because it emits harmony pitches distinct from the pad's note.

### Slot LFOs

Each slot has two independent LFOs that can modulate any parameter of any module in the slot's chain (synth, audio FX, MIDI FX), or each other.

**LFO settings:**
- **Target**: Which component and parameter to modulate
- **Enabled**: On/Off
- **Shape**: Sine, Tri, Saw, Square, S&H (sample & hold), Swishy (smooth random walk)
- **Sync**: Free-running (Hz) or tempo-synced (musical divisions from 16 bars to 1/32T, including triplet variants)
- **Depth**: Modulation amount (0-100%)
- **Polarity**: Unipolar (0 to depth) or Bipolar (-depth to +depth)
- **Phase**: Phase offset (0-360 degrees)
- **Retrigger**: Reset LFO phase on the first note-on of a new phrase

LFOs can also target each other's parameters (depth, rate, phase offset) for complex modulation.

An indicator (`~1`, `~2`, or `~1+2`) appears above targeted components in the chain editor.

### Slot Presets

- **Save / Save As**: Save the entire slot configuration (all modules + settings)
- **Delete**: Remove a saved preset
- **Load**: Scroll left to the slot overview, click to see saved presets

---

## Per-Set Slot State

Each Move Set maintains its own independent slot configurations. When you switch Sets, Schwung automatically saves the current slots and loads the slots associated with the new Set. A brief "Set Loaded" overlay confirms the switch.

**How it works:**
- Each Set remembers which synths, effects, and settings are loaded in each slot, plus Master FX
- Switching Sets saves the outgoing state and restores the incoming Set's state
- Slot audio fades smoothly during transitions to avoid clicks
- Changes you make to a slot are local to the current Set — they don't affect other Sets
- If RNBO Runner is active, the current RNBO graph and parameter state are saved/restored per Set

**Presets vs Set State:**
- **Set State** is automatic: whatever you have loaded in your slots is saved when you leave a Set and restored when you come back
- **Slot Presets** are separate: loading a preset copies it into the Set's state. If you tweak it afterwards, the tweaks live in the Set, not back in the preset. Loading the same preset in another Set gives you a fresh copy.

**New Sets** start with empty slots. **Duplicated Sets** (name contains "Copy") inherit the source Set's Schwung state automatically. To carry a configuration to a brand new Set, save it as a slot preset first, then load it in the new Set.

---

## Set Pages

Set Pages let you organize your sets into 8 switchable pages. Each page holds its own collection of sets, so you can group sets by project, genre, or live performance.

### Usage

- **Shift+Vol+Left**: Switch to the previous page
- **Shift+Vol+Right**: Switch to the next page

A toast overlay shows "Loading Page X/8..." during the switch. Move restarts automatically to load the new page's sets.

### How It Works

When you switch pages, Schwung:
1. Saves the current set (if dirty)
2. Moves all sets from `Sets/` into a stash directory for the current page
3. Moves the target page's sets from its stash into `Sets/`
4. Restarts Move to load the new sets

Each page's sets are completely independent. Per-set slot state (synths, effects, settings) is preserved per-set as usual.

### Settings

Set Pages is **enabled by default**. To disable:
1. Open **Global Settings** (**Shift+Vol + Step 2**)
2. Navigate to **Set Pages**
3. Toggle **Set Pages** to **Off**

The setting takes effect immediately (no restart needed) and persists across reboots.

---

## Connecting to Move Tracks

1. Set a Move track's **MIDI Out** to a channel (1-4)
2. Set the corresponding slot's **Receive Ch** to match
3. Play the Move track - its MIDI triggers the slot's synth

**Tip:** To prevent the native Move synth from playing on top of your Schwung synth, load an empty Drum Rack or Sampler preset on the Move track. This silences the native sound while still sending MIDI to Schwung.

Schwung also forwards pitch bend, mod wheel, sustain, and other CCs from external MIDI controllers.

**Tip:** Some synths and FX (i.e. Arp) utilize Midi Cloc for tempo sync. Make sure your Move is set to "Midi Clock: Out" for these to pick up sync correctly. 

---

## Master FX

Access via **Shift+Vol + Note/Session**. Contains four audio effect slots that process the mixed output of all instrument slots.

### Master FX LFOs

The Master FX chain also has two LFOs (**LFO 1** and **LFO 2** in the Master FX menu) that can target any parameter of the loaded master effects. These work the same as slot LFOs (same shapes, sync options, depth, and phase) but operate on the master FX chain rather than individual slots.

Global settings (Display, Audio, Screen Reader, Set Pages, Services, Updates, Help) are accessed via **Shift+Vol + Step 2**.

---

## Link Audio (Move 2.0+)

On Move firmware 2.0.0+, Link Audio lets you route Move's own track audio through Schwung's effects. This gives you access to effects like CloudSeed reverb, TapeDelay, or NAM amp models on your native Move tracks — but it changes how audio is mixed. Understanding the tradeoffs helps you decide when to use it.

### Link Audio On vs Off

| | **Link Audio On** | **Link Audio Off** |
|---|---|---|
| **Schwung synth** | Processed through slot FX and Master FX | Processed through slot FX and Master FX |
| **Native Move tracks** | Routed through Schwung slot FX per track | Stay on Move's native path |
| **Move's native Master FX** | Bypassed — Schwung rebuilds the mix from per-track streams | Active — applied to Move tracks normally |
| **Schwung Master FX** | Processes everything (Move tracks + Schwung synth) | Processes everything (Move post-native-FX + Schwung synth) |
| **Play delay** | Brief delay when pressing Play (Link quantum sync) | No delay |

### How It Works

**Link Audio On:** Move streams each track's audio separately via the Link protocol. Schwung intercepts these per-track streams, runs them through the corresponding slot's audio FX (combined with any Schwung synth in that slot), and reconstructs the final mix. Because Schwung is working with pre-mix audio, Move's native Master FX is bypassed entirely.

```
Move Track 1 → Slot 1 FX → ┐
Move Track 2 → Slot 2 FX → ├→ Schwung Master FX → Output
Move Track 3 → Slot 3 FX → │
Move Track 4 → Slot 4 FX → ┘
(+ Schwung synth mixed in per slot)
```

**Link Audio Off:** Move's audio goes through its normal path including native Master FX. Schwung synth are processed through their slot FX and mixed in. Everything combined runs through Schwung Master FX.

```
Move (all tracks + native Master FX) → ┐
Schwung Slot 1 (synth → FX) ────────────────├→ Schwung Master FX → Output
Schwung Slot 2 (synth → FX) ────────────────│
...                                     ┘
```

### Setup

1. **Enable Link on Move**: Go to Move's Settings > Link and toggle it on. This runs entirely on-device — no WiFi or USB connection is needed.
2. **Install or update Schwung** — the installer enables Link Audio support, but routing is off by default.
3. **Enable routing**: In **Global Settings > Audio** (**Shift+Vol + Step 2**), toggle **Move->Schwung** on. This routes Move's per-track audio through Schwung's slot FX.

**Note:** A restart of Move is sometimes required for the Link Audio subscriber to begin capturing audio. If you don't hear Move tracks being processed after enabling routing, restart Move.

### Example: Adding Reverb to a Move Track

1. Make sure Link Audio is enabled (see Setup above)
2. Open Slot 1 (**Shift+Vol + Track 1**)
3. Navigate to **Audio FX 1** and load CloudSeed (or any audio effect)
4. Optionally load a second effect in **Audio FX 2**
5. Play Move Track 1 — you'll hear it processed through your effects

### Notes

- Move must be on firmware **2.0.0 or later** for Link Audio support
- Each Move track maps to the matching slot number (Track 1 → Slot 1, etc.)
- A slot can have both a synth (triggered by MIDI) and audio FX (processing Move's track audio) simultaneously
- When pressing Play, Move syncs to the Link quantum, which introduces a brief delay before playback starts

---

## Native Sampler Bridge

Schwung audio can be fed into Move's native sampler for resampling.

In **Global Settings > Audio**, **Sample Src** controls this:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Native** | Disabled — sampler uses Move's normal input (default) |
| **Schwung Mix** | Replaces native sampler input with Schwung master output |

Recommended setup to avoid feedback:
1. Set **Sample Src** to **Schwung Mix**
2. In native Move Sampler, set source to **Line In**
3. Set monitoring to **Off**

If monitoring is on or routing is configured differently, audio feedback may occur.

---

## Recording

### Quantized Sampler

Access via **Shift+Sample**. Records Move's audio output (including Schwung synths) to WAV files, quantized to bars.

**Options:**
- **Source**: `Resample` (Move's mixed output including Schwung) or `Move Input` (whatever is set in Move's sample input - line-in, mic, etc.)
- **Duration**: Until stopped, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bars

**Usage:**
1. Press **Shift+Sample** to open the sampler
2. Use the jog wheel to select source and duration
3. Recording starts on a note event or pressing Play
4. Press **Sample** to stop (or it stops automatically at the set duration)

Recordings are saved to `Samples/Schwung/Resampler/YYYY-MM-DD/`.

Uses MIDI clock for accurate bar timing, falling back to project tempo if no clock is available. You can also use Move's built-in count-in for line-in recordings.

### Skipback

Press **Shift+Capture** (default) to save the most recent audio to disk.

Schwung continuously maintains a rolling buffer of audio (30 seconds by default, up to 5 minutes). When triggered, it dumps this buffer to a WAV file instantly without interrupting playback.

The shortcut can be changed in **Global Settings > Audio > Skipback** to **Sh+Vol+Cap** if Shift+Capture conflicts with other uses. The buffer length can be set in **Global Settings > Audio > Skipback Len** (30s, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m). Changing the length preserves whatever audio is already in the buffer (truncating the oldest samples if shrinking).

Files are saved to `Samples/Schwung/Skipback/YYYY-MM-DD/`. Uses the same source setting as the Quantized Sampler (Resample or Move Input).

---

## Overtake Modules

Overtake modules take full control of Move's display and controls. They live in the **Tools menu** below a divider — open Tools with **Shift+Vol + Jog Click** or **Shift+Vol + Step 13**, then select an overtake module from the list.

To exit an overtake module: **Shift+Vol + Jog Click** (works anytime)

To suspend an overtake module (keep it running in background): **Shift+Vol + Back**

**Note:** After exiting an overtake module, Move's pad and button LEDs won't refresh automatically. Change tracks or sets and they'll come back as they light back on.

### RNBO Runner

Requires [RNBO for Move](https://rnbo.cycling74.com) to be installed separately. RNBO Runner launches RNBO graphs as an overtake module, running on top of Move with full pad/knob control.

**Getting started:**
1. Install RNBO for Move (follow Cycling '74 instructions)
2. Open the Tools menu (Shift+Vol + Jog Click or Shift+Vol + Step 13)
3. Select RNBO Runner (below the Overtake divider)

**Features:**
- **Suspend/Resume**: Shift+Vol+Back suspends RNBO Runner — it keeps running in the background. Re-open Tools and re-select it to resume with LED state restored.
- **MIDI from Move**: RNBO receives MIDI from Move's sequencer on Channel 16. You can sequence RNBO devices from Move, use MIDI capture, etc.
- **Per-set state**: The current RNBO graph and all parameter tweaks are saved automatically with each Schwung set. Switch sets and your RNBO sound follows.
- **Display mirroring**: Works with Schwung's display mirror feature.
- **Resampling and Skipback**: RNBO audio is included in resampling and skipback captures.
- **Master FX and Volume**: RNBO audio routes through the master FX chain and master volume.

**Note:** Schwung includes a JACK shadow driver (but not JACK itself — RNBO provides it). If you want to build other JACK applications for Move, the driver is available.

---

## Tools Menu

Access via **Shift+Vol + Step 13**. Tools are standalone utilities that run outside the normal slot system.

### File Browser

Browse files and folders on your Move. Two starting roots:
- **User Library**: Your samples, presets, and recordings
- **System Files**: The Schwung directory (shows a warning before entry)

**Navigation:**
- **Jog wheel**: Scroll through files and folders
- **Jog click**: Open a folder, or show file actions for a file
- **Shift+Jog click**: Show actions for any item (files or folders)
- **Back**: Go up one directory or exit

**File actions:** Play (WAV files), Duplicate, Rename, Delete, Copy to..., Move to..., New Folder (on directories).

**Play:** Selecting Play on a .wav file starts audio preview through Move's speakers. A progress bar and time display are shown. Push jog or press back to stop.

### Song Mode

Sequence clips across time to build full songs from your set's clip layout.

**How it works:** Song Mode reads your set's clips and tempo, then lets you arrange pad assignments into an ordered list of steps. Each step triggers all 4 tracks simultaneously, advancing automatically based on bar timing.

**Building a song:**
1. Select a step with the jog wheel or step buttons
2. Tap pads to assign clips for each track
3. The first pad press on an empty step copies the previous step, so you only change what differs
4. **Shift+Pad** on steps 2+ sets that track to **continue** (shown with a trailing quote mark: `"`) so it won't retrigger
5. Steps display track assignments as clip letters (A-H), or a trailing quote (`"`) for continue

**Playback:**
- **Play**: Start from current step
- **Shift+Play**: Start from beginning
- **Play again**: Stop (returns to where playback started)

**Recording:**
- **Rec**: Record audio from current step
- **Shift+Rec**: Record from beginning
- **Rec again**: Stop recording
- Auto-stops after a configurable tail period (default 2 bars) to capture reverb/delay tails
- **Tail setting**: Last menu item — jog click cycles through 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 bars
- Files saved to `Recordings/Song Mode/` with set name in filename

**Loop mode:** Press **Loop** to toggle. When on, playback wraps back to the first step after the last step ends. Shows `[L]` in the header. Disabled during recording.

**Editing:**
- **Hold step** or **Jog click** on a step: Edit step settings
- **Repeats**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
- **Bar Length**: `Longest` (default), `Shortest`, or `Custom`
- **Custom Bars** appears when `Bar Length = Custom`
- In step settings, jog wheel selects a parameter; jog click toggles edit mode for that parameter
- Tracks shown with a trailing quote (`"`) as continue do not retrigger and do not contribute to step bar-length calculation
- Step rows show duration at right as `4`, or `4x2` when repeats are >1
- **Copy**: Duplicate selected step
- **Delete**: Remove selected step
- **Shift+Delete**: Clear entire song
- **Shift+Up/Down**: Reorder steps
- **Undo**: Restore previous state (up to 20 levels)

**Navigation:**
- **Jog wheel**: Scroll through steps
- **Step buttons**: Select steps directly
- **Left/Right**: Page through steps (16 per page)

Step LEDs: green = has content, red = now playing, white = selected. Pad LEDs highlight the current step's assigned clips in red.

**Persistence:** Song arrangements save automatically per set. Re-entering Song Mode for the same set restores your song.

## Schwung Manager (Web)

Schwung Manager is a web interface for managing your Move from any device on the same network. Access it at `http://move.local:7700`.

### Features

- **Modules**: Browse, install, uninstall, and update modules from the catalog. Install custom modules from a GitHub URL or tarball upload.
- **Files**: Browse, upload, download, rename, and delete files on the device. Useful for managing module assets (soundfonts, patches, ROMs).
- **Config**: Adjust display, audio, screen reader, and feature settings. Changes take effect instantly on the device.
- **System**: Check version, view debug logs, and upgrade Schwung.
- **Help**: Browse on-device help for Schwung and installed modules.
- **Screen Mirroring**: Quick access at `move.local:7700/mirror` — streams Move's OLED display to your browser.

### Notes

- `move.local` is advertised by Move's built-in avahi — works on Mac, Linux, and Windows with Bonjour
- `move.local:80` remains the stock Move manager, completely untouched by Schwung
- Settings changed on the web UI sync to the device in real time (and vice versa)
- No authentication is required — anyone on the network can access it

---

## File Browser (Web)

Schwung also includes a standalone file browser (powered by filebrowser) for more advanced file management.

### Setup

1. Open **Global Settings > Services** (**Shift+Vol + Step 2**), or toggle in Schwung Manager at `move.local:7700/config`
2. Toggle **File Browser** to **On**
3. Open `http://move.local:404` in a browser

The file browser serves the `/data/UserData` directory, giving you access to samples, recordings, presets, and other user files. You can upload, download, rename, move, and delete files.

### Notes

- File Browser is **off by default** and must be enabled via the settings toggle
- The built-in file manager in Schwung Manager (`move.local:7700/files`) is available without enabling this
- No authentication is required — anyone on the network can access it

---

## Screen Reader

Schwung includes an optional screen reader for accessibility, using text-to-speech to announce UI elements.

Toggle via **Global Settings > Screen Reader** (**Shift+Vol + Step 2**), or **Shift+Note/Session** when Shadow UI is disabled.

Settings:
- **Speed**: 0.5x to 6.0x
- **Pitch**: 80-180 Hz
- **Volume**: 0-100%
- **Debounce**: 0-1000ms

Can be enabled during installation with `--enable-screen-reader`.

---

## Display Mirror

Stream Move's 128x64 OLED display to any browser on your network in real time. Useful for remote monitoring, screen capture, or development.

### Setup

1. Open **Global Settings > Display** (**Shift+Vol + Step 2**), or toggle in Schwung Manager at `move.local:7700/config`
2. Toggle **Mirror Display** to **On**
3. Open `http://move.local:7700/mirror` in a browser (or `http://move.local:7681`)

The display updates at ~30 fps and shows whatever is on screen — both normal Move UI and Shadow UI.

### Notes

- Mirror Display is **off by default** and must be enabled via the settings toggle
- The setting persists across reboots
- Multiple browsers can connect simultaneously (up to 8 clients)

---

## In-App Help

Schwung includes a built-in help viewer accessible from **Global Settings > [Help...]** (**Shift+Vol + Step 2**). It contains a quick reference for shortcuts, slot setup, recording, and other features — readable directly on Move's display.

If the screen reader is enabled, help pages are read aloud automatically when opened.

---

## Mute and Solo

You can mute and solo individual slots using the Mute button (next to the track buttons):

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Mute + Track 1-4** | Toggle mute on that slot |
| **Shift + Mute + Track 1-4** | Toggle solo on that slot |

Muted slots are silenced but continue processing MIDI. Solo isolates a single slot.

## Tips

- Each Move Set has its own slot configurations — switch Sets to switch between different instrument setups
- Use Set Pages to organize sets by project or performance — Shift+Vol+Left/Right to switch
- If something goes wrong, use Move's DFU restore mode to reset

## Analytics

Schwung sends anonymous usage statistics to help prioritize development. On first launch, you'll be asked whether to enable this — the default is **Yes**. You can change this at any time in Settings > Analytics.

### What is collected

When enabled, the following events are sent:

| Event | When | Data |
|-------|------|------|
| `app_launched` | Schwung starts | Host version |
| `module_census` | Schwung starts | List of installed module IDs, count |
| `module_added` | New module detected at startup | Module ID, version |
| `module_upgraded` | Module version changed at startup | Module ID, old version, new version |
| `module_loaded` | A module is loaded | Module ID |
| `module_installed` | A new module is installed from the Store | Module ID, module version |

Every event also includes a randomly generated anonymous ID (UUID v4) stored on the device. This ID has no connection to your identity.

### What is NOT collected

- No IP address (explicitly suppressed in every request)
- No personal information
- No audio, MIDI, or performance data
- No device identifiers or fingerprinting
- No tracking across devices

### How it works

Events are sent as fire-and-forget HTTP POSTs to [PostHog](https://posthog.com). No third-party SDK is used — just a background curl request that doesn't block or retry. If it fails, the data is simply lost.

The anonymous ID is stored at `/data/UserData/schwung/anonymous-id`. Deleting this file generates a new one on next launch.

### Disabling analytics

Toggle off in **Settings > Analytics**. When disabled, no events are sent and no network requests are made.

## Troubleshooting

### Schwung Manager not accessible

If `http://move.local:7700` isn't working, schwung-manager may not be running. This can happen if you upgraded Schwung on-device (via the Module Store) from an older version.

**Fix (run once from a terminal):**

```
ssh root@move.local "sh /data/UserData/schwung/scripts/post-update.sh && reboot"
```

Move will reboot and Schwung Manager should be available at `http://move.local:7700`.
